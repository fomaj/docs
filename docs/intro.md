# Fomaj Intro

Fomaj is a  risk free prediction market. 

This project was inspired by two other projects in defi space.

-  PoolTogether (https://pooltogether.com/)
-  Pancakeswap Prediction (https://pancakeswap.finance/prediction)

Pooltogether is a risk-free lottery project. And pancake-prediction is a simple defi app where you can bet if `BNB/USD` will rise or a fall. 

But what if there is an dapp, where you can bet on certain outcome (in this case the price of `CKB/USD`) and not lose anything when you predict wrong? Well, this is what Fomaj does.

>Right now users can only predict the price of `CKB/USD`, but this can be imporved upon to add other assets and even for predictable scenarios outside of crypto.  

Now you are probably wondering how can we reward the winners when there are no losers? We will discuss about this in-depth later. 

First, let's setup the required tools/accounts. 

## Prerequisites

There are few things you need to have setup to work with the app. 

- Metamask
- Godwoken L2 account
