# Intro

Fomaj is a  risk free prediction market. 

This project was inspired by two other projects in defi space.

-  PoolTogether (https://pooltogether.com/)
-  Pancakeswap Prediction (https://pancakeswap.finance/prediction)

Pooltogether is a risk-free lottery project. Pancake-prediction is a simple defi app where you can bet if `BNB/USD` will rise or a fall. 

The idea behind Fomaj is to build a risk free prediction marketplace. 

Fomaj is a dapp, where users can bet on certain outcome (in this case the price of `CKB/USD`).
If a user predicts the correct outcome, they get rewards. If the user predicts wrong, *they will not lose anything*. 

>Right now users can only predict the price of `CKB/USD`, but this can be imporved upon to add other assets and even for predictable scenarios outside of crypto.  

Now you are probably wondering how can we reward the winners when there are no losers? We will discuss about this in-depth later. 

First, let's setup the required tools/accounts. 

## Prerequisites
