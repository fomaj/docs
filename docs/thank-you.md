# Thank You

Lot of effort went into this tiny project. I have plans to launch this properly once polyjuice mainnet is launcehd.

Thanks `Nervos Foundation` for hosting this hackathon. As someone who hold `CKB`, I want to see `Nervos Network` thrive even if this project fails to win any prizes in this hackathon. 


The hackathon also helped me to understand what `Nervos` is trying to do. Hoping to work on more projects utilizing `Nervos` blockchain in future. 

Thank you.
